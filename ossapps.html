			xsr is a lithe program based solely on Xlib (so its fast and small) that reads in audio data from the soundcard and displays it on the root window in an entertaining and neat fashion. it also does fourier analysis and looks really cool. 
			it is fast enough to run in the background without interfering with anything.</p>

			Dynamic - Dumps your audio cd's to /dev/dsp or file. Audio data
			is read digitally and passes the cpu on its way to sound card and file.
			Allows forward, reverse and reverse squared play. Pitch control is
			available. Further more cd samples of arbitrary length (1 frame to the
			whole cd) are selectable via a time code gui. Dynamic records exactly as
			it sounds - real time editing is recorded.</p>
