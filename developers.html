			<h2 id="What_is_OSS">What is OSS?</h2>
			<p>Open Sound System (OSS) is the first attempt in unifying
			the digital audio architecture for UNIX. OSS is a set of device drivers
			that provide a uniform API across all the major UNIX architectures. It
			supports Sound Blaster or Windows Sound System  compatible sound cards 
			which can be plugged into
			any UNIX workstation supporting the ISA or PCI bus architecture. OSS also
			supports workstations with on-board digital audio hardware.</p>
			<p>Traditionally, each UNIX vendor has provided their own API for processing
			digital audio. This meant that applications written to a particular UNIX
			audio API had to be re-written or ported, with possible loss of functionality,
			to another version of UNIX. Applications written to the OSS API, need to
			be designed once and then simply re-compiled on any supported UNIX architecture.
			OSS is source code compatible across all the platforms.</p>
			<p>Most UNIX workstations, thus far, have only provided support for digital
			audio sampling and playback (business audio). OSS brings the world of MIDI
			and electronic music to the workstation environment. With the advent of
			streaming audio, speech recognition/generation, computer telephony, Java
			and other multimedia technologies, applications on UNIX can now provide
			the same audio capabilities as those found on Windows NT, OS/2, Windows
			95 and the Macintosh operating systems. OSS also provides synchronized
			audio capabilities required for desktop video and animation playback.</p>

			<h2 id="Developer_Community">Developer Community</h2>
			<h3 id="What_is_the_OSS_Developer_Community_and_why">What is the OSS Developer Community and why?</h3>
			<p>4Front Technologies has decided to move further development of
			Open Sound System to a community or consortium within next few
			years. The goal of this community is to make OSS the common sound
			subsystem/API for most Unix/Linux/POSIX operating systems.</p>
			<p>There are almost a dozen of different sound subsystems used in
			these operating systems. Some of them are based on some older
			versions of the OSS API while the others are proprietary. Some of
			them are actively maintained while the others are running out of
			steam. Each of them are based on their own source base which makes
			even all the different OSS implementations slightly incompatible.
			In addition each system has implemented their own drivers for all
			devices they support and they are not protable between the
			systems.</p>
			<p>The situation is most absurd for software developers. Today
			most Unix/Linux/POSIX systems have the same system calls,
			libraries and core commands. There may be slightly different
			implementations of them but it's pretty trivial to write
			applications that compile and work without even smallest changes
			under all the operating systems. Even GUI based applications can
			be ported easily since most of the systems support GTK+ (OTOH some
			of them still ship only the GTK+ 1.x libraries).</p>
			<p>But sound is different. To get sound working the developers
			will have to implement different sound &ldquo;plugins&rdquo; for
			each system. In addition there are many library/daemon based
			interfaces that try to fix limitations of some of the sound
			subsystems. Each plugin will take couple of days to develop and
			few days, weeks or even months to test and debug (depending on the
			system). This means unbearable amount of work when compared to the
			rest of the application. All that time could have spent on
			developing something useful.</p>
			<p>This is where Open Sound System comes in the picture. We have
			spent 25+ man years on developing a kernel level sound subsystem
			that is easily portable to any oprating system one can imagine.
			There are already drivers for practically all sound devices
			available in the market. The feature set of the API has reached
			the saturation point and there are not much (important) features
			that could be added. Even the API documentation is almost finished
			now. And it's finally open sourced (again). So all reasons that
			still would prevent OSS from becoming the common Unix/POSIX sound
			system are political.</p>
			<p>We have realized long time ago that OSS will not be accepted by
			the open source communities as long as it's not open sourced. It's
			also likely that political fights will make this goal impossible
			if the OSS project is not controlled by some democratic
			organization.</p>
			<p>The Open Sound Developer Community is will be the first step to
			this direction. We will move control of the Open Sound System
			software to a developer community or consortium in the future.
			However executing this plan may take few years. The first step is
			availability of the source code which makes it possible to our
			customers, third parties, potential contributors and everybody who
			is interested to take a look at the code and use or experiment
			with it.</p>
			<p>Next steps such as starting to accept contributions and moving
			the decision making towards the community will take place later.</p>
			<p>4Front Technologies will continue developing the software
			together with the community. In addition we will provide
			professional support, consulting and development services for Open
			Sound System and related services.</p>

			<h3 id="Goals_of_the_Open_Sound_Community">Goals of the Open Sound Community</h3>
			<p>The goal of the cumminity is to bring together persons and
			organizations interested in developing Open Sound System as the
			common sound subsystem for various operating systems. In
			particular we welcome all companies and communities creating
			operating systems, competing sound subsystems or sound hardware to
			join.</p>
			<p>The community will be politically as neutral as possible. We
			promote things open source development model and Open Sound System
			as the common sound API. However we don't try to enforce anything.
			Companies selling &ldquo;closed source&rdquo; operating systems or
			applications are also welcome to join. We are also willing to work
			in co-operation with authors of the other sound APIs to make them
			to co-exist with OSS.</p>

			<h3 id="Contributing_your_code_to_OSS">Contributing your code to OSS</h3>
			<p>If you have made some simple change (few line bug fix) to OSS
			you can mail the diff (diff -c or diff -u) to the oss-devel
			mailing list. We will check the change and apply it to the sources
			if it's OK.</p>
			<p>If you are planning to do bigger contributions (new driver, new
			OS port or some new features) then you should join the community
			and to fill the contributor's agreement (see below). However it's
			highly recommended that you propose your changes on the oss-devel
			mailing list before even starting to do any hacking on OSS. Also
			check the <a href="http://developer.opensound.com/opensource_oss/contributing.html">instructions
			for making contributions</a>.</p>

			<h3 id="Joining_the_community">Joining the community</h3>
			<p>For the	time being there is no registration page available for new
			members. You need to fill in the <a href="Contributor-Agreement.pdf">contributor
			agreement</a> and send it to 4Front Technologies. Fax it to <b>(+1)
			310 202 0496</b> (or scan and send it as an E-mail
			attachment). Then send E-mail to <a href="mailto:support@opensound.com">support@opensound.com</a>
			and tell us the nick name you would like to use. The nick will be
			required to access our source repository and bug tracking system.
			We will then E-mail you the further instructions.</p>
			<p>The idea of the contributor
			agreement is that you give 4Front Technologies non-exclusive
			rights to distribute your code as a part of OSS. In return we
			guarantee that if your contribution is released under an license
			it will also be distributed under all the others (including GPLv2,
			CDDL1.0 and BSD). For you this means that we cannot make your code
			closed source by distributing it <U>only</U> under some binary
			only license. Non-exclusive means that you can distribute the same
			code yourself under any license provided that it doesn't conflict
			with the terms of the contributor's agreement.</p>
			<p>We have created an <a href="http://mailman.opensound.com/mailman/listinfo/oss-devel">oss-devel</a>
			mailing list for persons who are interested in developing Open
			Sound System itself and applications for it. Subscribe to the list
			if you are interested in joining the community or if you are
			interested about OSS development in some other way.</p>
			<p>We are setting up a source
			repository (probably Mercurial) and a bug tracking system
			(Bugzilla) in the near future. Until that the contributions can be
			posted to the oss-devel mailing list.</p>

			<h3 id="Sponsoring_Open_Sound_System">Sponsoring Open Sound System</h3>
			<p>Open Sound System is now an open source project. This means
			that we have to fund the development in some other way than
			selling the software itself.</p>
			<p>There are two ways to sponsor development of Open Sound System.
			The preferred way is to order an <a href="http://www.opensound.com/ossorder.html">OSS
			license</a>. In this way you will get free technical support.</p>
			<p>Another way to donate is to send a PayPal payment (any amount)
			to <a href="mailto:hannu@opensound.com">hannu@opensound.com</a>.</p>
			<p>Third way is to sponsor a port of Open Sound System for a new
			operating system or (Linux) distribution. We will also do custom
			driver development for new sound devices (open source or
			proprietary). Please contact <a href="mailto:sales@opensound.com">sales@opensound.com</a>
			for more info.</p>

			<h3 id="Possible_projects_for_contributors">Possible projects for contributors</h3>
			<p>There are numerous areas where contributors could give their
			helping hand. Below are just some examples of them:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Maintaining and improving the operating system
				interfaces/ports for Linux, FreeBSD and SCO Unixware/OpenServer
				(4Front is maintaining the Solaris interface under a contract).</p></li>
				<li><p>Creating new operating system ports for NetBSD, OpenBSD,
				AIX, HP-UX, LynxOS, VxWorks, MacOS and so on (even Windows might
				be possible). 
				</p></li>
				<li><p>Creating OSS installation packages for various Linux and
				BSD versions/distributions and keeping them up to date with the
				latest kernel and distribution versions. This has been beyond our
				resources and for this reason installing OSS requires
				availability of the kernel development environment (kernel
				source, gcc, binutils, make, etc) in each customer system.</p>
				<li><p>Maintainers are needed for various low level drivers.
				Maintaining some drivers such as HD audio (Azalia) and USB
				currently require more resources than we have. USB is currently
				supported only under Linux and Solaris but not under FreeBSD and
				SCO.</p></li>
				<li><p>There are low level drivers missing for many devices such
				as Hammerfall/HDSP.</p></li>
				<li><p>Adding power management support to OSS. OSS will need a
				common framework that works with any operating system we support.
				In addition several low level drivers will have to be modified to
				work with this framework.</p></li>
				<li><p>Adding support for modem codecs available in many laptops.
				Related to this is creation of a soft modem application that is
				compatible with OSS.</p></li>
				<li><p>The ALSA compatibility interface needs an maintainer who
				preferably has good knowledge of ALSA's internals (alsa-driver
				and/or alsa-lib). OSS has now a library based ALSA emulation and
				also an experimental kernel space one (known as Cuckoo).</p></li>
				<li><p>Upgrading or creating the OSS plugins of various audio
				applications to be OSS 4.0 compatible. Many applications are
				designed for the 10 years old OSS 3.8 API and they use many
				features that are unreliable. For example parsing /dev/sndstat to
				find devices, use of the mixer API for recording/play volume
				control or recording source selection and use of certain ioctl
				calls or features like non-blocking I/O for wrong purposes. OSS
				has has proper solutions for these problems for years.</p></li>
				<li><p>The new MIDI subsystem of OSS is currently under
				development and there are jobs for several developers who have
				good understanding of MIDI and computer music applications.</p></li>
			</ul>
